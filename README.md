INSPIRATION:
Over recent years, things have drastically changed in the recruitment industry. Owing to the advent of technology, companies no longer use newspapers and leaflets to advertise about the vacancies in their firm. Instead, they rely on digital platforms like job search mobile app or web portals to recruit the best talent for their organization. On the other hand, job seekers are relieved of running from one company to another for dropping their resume.

WHAT IT DOES:
The online recruitment sites have witnessed exponential growth since the 2000s. With the internet becoming a prominent part of everyone’s life, there has been an increase in the use of recruitment sites by both job seekers and employers.
Indeed has become the top-rated job and recruitment portal across the world. The platform connects over 250 million unique visitors every month by allowing them unrestrained access to its large job database.
Another interesting report shows that the Indeed mobile app has been downloaded 46 million times globally, which includes over 20 million downloads in the U.S. alone. Over 50% of the platform’s traffic now comes from mobile devices.
